PseudoCode

The point of this program will be to let me topic model docsouth's slave narratives paragraph-by-paragraph, rather than text-by-text

main ()
    import folder with texts

    for each text in the folder,

        read text

    until reach end of text,

        for (first character of paragraph to last character of paragraph)
        write text into new file named [variable name] UNTIL come to end of paragraph
        when paragraph ends, 
            save file, close file
        
        







add author's gender to each text

add date of publication to file





















    Variable name = function to name each new paragraph file

            should be named paragraph 1, graf 2, etc etc.
