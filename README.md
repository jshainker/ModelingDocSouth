Topic modeling DocSouthâ€™s North American Slave Narratives Database using MALLET

This repository contains the files from my semester-long digital history project for Dr. Trevor Owens' History & New Media graduate class at American University.

This project largely consisted of me playing around with MALLET, familiarizing myself with how it works, and learning how to manipulate text files with Python. In the future, I hope to learn more about the inner workings of MALLET and become more familiar with the historiography of enslavement narratives. Only then can I really make a novel historical argument with this research.
